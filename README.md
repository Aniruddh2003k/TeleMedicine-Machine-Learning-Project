# TeleMedicine-Machine-Learning-Project
Developed a machine learning model to predict viral infection likelihood, deployed as an interactive web application.
The project develops a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of viral infections using a dataset with medical parameters.

The model was implemented using various machine learning techniques and deployed as a web-based application using Streamlit. The system allows users to interactively input patient data, receive predictions, and visualize the results. The objective of this project is to contribute to predictive healthcare systems by leveraging machine learning algorithms and providing an accessible interface for non-technical users.

Literature survey reveals that their pre-processing and handling of missing values is important and leaves more room for improvements which gives more accurate results, as a result the accuracy of the model is improved significantly. The existing system uses a basic level of pre- processing of data and then using pre-processed data in producing models. Unlike the existing system, this project uses improved pre-processing techniques and hence producing significantly improved results. Using this, we can offer people better predictions and increase/decrease the Cost of Insurance, which would benefit both the Insurance Company and the Individual.
